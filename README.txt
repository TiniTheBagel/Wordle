Command Line Wordle
Created by: Tini

I spent forever making this so if you are trying it out thank you. <3

Just execute the src/wordle-exec file in the terminal to run the program.

PS: The program will not run on Windows or Mac. It will only execute on Linux (I am using a rasberry pi so that might limit what can run the program even more idk).
